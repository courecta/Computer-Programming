# 41247044S Lo Yuan-Chiun

p1: No further comments

p2: Works like the comment that the discussion board had. That is, the TA should import the subdirectories under this folder. Afterwards, please CORRECTLY enter the path. Not my fault if you can't do this bro ngl.

p3: Nothing to note, implemented a more mathematically verbose implementation.

p4: Using bmp files that are generated from p3 worked, but I tried to download some from online and they didn't work so uhhh idk why, and I asked chatgpt and it said that it might be since that the implementation works only with 24-bit uncompressed BMPs, which works well with 54 bit headers, so implementing other cases isn't really a worthwile case imo

p5: uhhhh. Oh man, currently, the box example was good but the circle had a bit of an error near the closest to the light source. Idk why its like that bro ngl. Originally I used the naive process that took 24 minutes to process the circle but this more optimized method can do it almost instantly, but the light error persisted.

EDIT: I FIXED IT BY DECREASING THE EPSILON FROM 1e-6 TO 1e-9 (but the line isn't there, but I think that's not supposed to be there in the first place imo)

p6: pretty nice. Used deepseek's reasoning model, meanwhile gemini couldn't identify it (2.0, not 2.5)
