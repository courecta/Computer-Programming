p1: Pretty nice, I used my own python script to generate key texts and tested the encrypt/decrypts but I'm not quite sure if its correct? Also, I do not have a mid01.c, so don't try to do that. I know I could've compiled 2 objects and linked them against 2 seperate source code files, but since there is NO EXPLICIT instruction to do so, hence according to the problem instructions, I ONLY have a mid0101 and mid0102.

p2: This one was pretty cool as well, I did follow the comments from the discussion board for handling some exceptions, so there's that.

p3: This one is the weird one. No matter what I do or adjust, I couldn't get the size of the output to be like figure 1. Here, I used various methods, such as adjusting the triangle drawing methods, but sticking with a baycentric approach or not made no difference. This along with adjusting epsilon values also made no significant change, since, obviously, it wasn't that the shapes or colors were wrong, its that the canvas looks really large compared to the shapes, so it looks really big. Here, i am just going to leave that up to fate or what have you, cause it might be a machine error, or no matter what LLM handles it, its found nothing wrong (I've asked them all on top of attempting to adjust the code myself). I originally found that maybe a method of scaling the shape size parameters to be the solution, but according to the TA in the discussion board, this should not be the case, so that's that i guess.

p4: nope lmao
