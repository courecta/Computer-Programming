In the middle of handling dependencies for problem 1, my pacman suddenly broke. I started trying to fix it by donwloading all these tar packages and manually building them from scratch. Nothing worked and almost thought about rebooting my ISO, but I think I'll handle that after the exam.

My last question to the professor: people talk enough about the effects of AI on jobs or the economy, but what do YOU wish to see come into the world because of AI (good, or bad, up to you), it can be programming-oriented or maybe anything else on your mind? Thank you for these lessons and learning experiences!
